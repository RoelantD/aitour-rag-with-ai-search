# Production-ready RAG with Azure AI Search

## Session Desciption

Learn how to build a production-ready Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application to chat over your domain's data with Azure AI Search. Discover the benefits of hybrid search with semantic ranker to find both vector and keyword-based results amongst billions of documents. Explore different approaches to data ingestion, to extract, split, vectorize, and store your data in Azure AI Search. Consider multiple ways to evaluate your RAG app answers, to ensure high-quality responses. Finally, see how you can productionize your RAG app with efficient vector storage, private network deployment, and user authentication.

## Learning Outcomes

* Basics of vector embeddings and vector search strategies
* Azure AI Search option: full-text search, vector search, hybrid search, semantic ranker
* Data ingestion process for Azure AI Search, manual and integrated vectorization feature
* Evaluation strategies for RAG app answers: AI Studio, Promptflow-evals SDK
* Efficient vector storage with quantization
* Security best practices: private network deployment, user authentication, data access control

## Technology Used

* Azure OpenAI
* Azure AI Search
* Python
